Disclaimer: That works for Ubuntu 16.04, don't know for other versions.

<h1 style="text-align:center";> Install Tensorflow with GPU support</h1>


1. Delete previous TF installations from ALL `dist` (or `site`)`-packages`, like `/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages` (in Python 2 and/or Python 3, DON'T FORGET THE ANACONDA FOLDER, for me was `/home/marc/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages`)

2. Install NVIDIA drivers http://www.webupd8.org/2016/06/how-to-install-latest-nvidia-drivers-in.html

  * Don't take the last version (take like 367) because it isn't stable yet.

  * AT LEAST check with the command `nvidia-smi`: if not found, not good
  
  * http://askubuntu.com/questions/206283/how-can-i-uninstall-a-nvidia-driver-completely might be useful to get a clean install


3. Follow tutorial here https://alliseesolutions.wordpress.com/2016/09/08/install-gpu-tensorflow-from-sources-w-ubuntu-16-04-and-cuda-8-0-rc/

  * WARNING: If python was installed with anaconda, make sure that the Python Path in TF configuration step are in the Anaconda Folder (and not what is told in the article) - was default for me 

  * SECOND WARNING: the CUDNN Version to put in the configuration is `5` and not `5.1.5`)

  * THIRD WARNING: might get an error at the "Build & Install Pip Package" part, but easy to workaround (Google the error, and if you find it I'll add it there because I don't remember by now)
  
  * FOURTH WARNING: Java jdk 9 seems to cause problems with bazel, you may need to delete java and install an older version (THANKS Reda Boumahdi)
  
   * FIFTH WARNING: If at step `./configure # tensorflow` you get
	`Invalid SYCL 1.2 library path. /usr/local/computecpp/lib/libComputeCpp.so cannot be found` try https://www.codeplay.com/.../computes.../computecpp/download 
	
		sudo mkdir /usr/local/computecpp
		sudo cp -r ComputeCpp-CE-0.1.1-Linux/lib/ /usr/local/computecpp/ (THANKS AurÃ©lien Smith)


4. Test with `python` // `>>> import tensorflow as tf`

  * If that works, try `sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True))`
	
  * It should display your GPU. If it doesn't, or if `import tensorflow as tf` led to error messages, THAT becomes interesting. Go to step 5.

  * If you didn't get any error message but the GPU isn't there, you probably don't use the "right" TF, which means that you didn't clean up all folders before install. Try doing that, as well as installing NVIDIA drivers if it doesn't work


5. You probably got a message like "Couldn't open CUDA library libcuda.so.1". It takes a few steps to solve this:

  * Update `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64`

  * Find `libcuda.so.367.57` (or the version of your NVIDIA driver) with `find / -iname "libcuda.so.1"`. It should appear at least in one folder apparently unrelated to CUDA, like `/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu` or `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/`. There you can also find the file `libcuda.367.57`.

  * If it doesn't exist, try `sudo apt-get install libcuda1-367`

  * Go to your `/usr/local/cuda/lib64` folder and create a symbolic link to the previous file: 
	`sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcuda.so.367.57 libcuda.so.1`

  * If the destination file already exists, delete it and retry
  
  * Retry step 4

6. That's where I won: FIREWORKS
